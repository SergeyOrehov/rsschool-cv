## Shorty about myself:

I am 30 years old. My specialty is an energy engineer.  
My favorite subjects at school were mathematics and physics.Therefore, the direction of further training was obvious.I studied at a technical university as an engineer. After graduation, I worked as a design engineer, where I studied AutoCAD well. But working with code attracted me much more.I wanted to change my specialty and start programming.I chose Frontend as my direction because I liked creating HTML pages and animating them with JavaScript.  
I finished several courses on website layout, took a little training in JavaScript. I am actively studying English. My goal is to get a job in a large IT company, where I can fully realize myself.
